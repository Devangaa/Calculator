# Calculator

A simple C++ calculator with limited operation. This Calculator can perform 4 operations and can perform 3 simple calculation operations on the latest version currently, the third version. This calculator still operated with simple cmd program, not an exe program, maybe soon.

## How to?

Download and extract selected file, then open the .sln file with Visual Studio. Then run it.

## Usage

```cpp
//opt if +
if (opt == '+') {
	cout << "\n" << a << " " << opt << "\n";
	printf("b = ");
	cin >> b;
	this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(750));
	system("CLS");

	//opt2 inv
	cout << "\n" << a << " " << opt << " " << b << "\n";
	printf("Operation ( + | - | * | / | = ) : ");
	cin >> opt2;
	this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(750));
	system("CLS");
```
The simple way is to enter numeric input and operations one by one. If the input is wrong, the program will immediately display an error and force close. Can perform the operation again after performing the operation without re-running cmd.
