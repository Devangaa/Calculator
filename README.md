# Calculator

A simple calculator with limited operation.

## How to?

Download and extract selected file, then open the .sln file with Visual Studio. Then run it.

## Usage

```cpp
//opt if +
if (opt == '+') {
	cout << "\n" << a << " " << opt << "\n";
	printf("b = ");
	cin >> b;
	this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(750));
	system("CLS");

	//opt2 inv
	cout << "\n" << a << " " << opt << " " << b << "\n";
	printf("Operation ( + | - | * | / | = ) : ");
	cin >> opt2;
	this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(750));
	system("CLS");
```
The simple way is to enter numeric input and operations one by one. If the input is wrong, the program will immediately display an error and force close.
